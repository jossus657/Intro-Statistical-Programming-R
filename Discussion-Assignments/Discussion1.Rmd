Equation 1
```{r}
7+8
```

Equation 2
```{r}
10/6
```

Equation 3
```{r}
(13/2)^2*pi
```

Equation 4
```{r}
2^2 + 7^2 - 5^2
```

Equation 5
```{r}
((30+5) * 2)/(30^(3/2))
```

Equation 6
```{r}
sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) - 2
```

For this equation the answer should be 0 but R outputs an answer extremely small 
that is approximately 0. This is because R acts as a calculator and cannot 
compute the sqrt(2) * sqrt(2) as 2 like we can. R takes the literal decimal 
value of rad 2 (which goes on as a decimal) to compute the equation and R 
has a certain limit of decimal places it is able to store. Thus, while the 
answer is 0 R will never be able to compute the equation as 0 but as an 
extremely small and long decimal that is approximately 0.
